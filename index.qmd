My name is Sophia Brown, I am an undergraduate student at Chaminade University.

I love doing BioMedical research, Environmental research, learning new things and obtaining new certificates. I was a Girl Scout for 13 years and got my Girl Scout Gold Award. I moved to Hawai'i so that I may continue my passion for researching the local flora and fauna where ever I may live at the time.

Thank you.
