    "text": "Penguins are cool!\nPenguins have been peoples fascinations for millennial. I strive to provide visuals of their anatomy, population, and the inner workings of correlation to one another.\nThis data was introduced and provided to me through the CS 201 Introduction to R class. As I have worked with this data set for almost 8 weeks, I have gotten very familiar with it and had much practice with it regarding Data Vis.\nI chose this data due to my own strengths and familiarity with the data itself. I also genuinely find penguins interesting, especially their anatomy and inability to fly.\nThis is the Penguins’ data:\nThis graph illustrates the relationship between body mass of penguins and their flipper length. As we all know, a smaller p-value means that there is less chance the data is random. Thus, looking at these points on the graph, there is a high chance these relationships are related and not random.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis second data visualization shows the positive correlation of culmen length and flipper length. Again, the p-value is minute, thus these correlations are more likely to be random, rather than related.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis last visualization expresses the strong relationship between the species of penguin and their habitat (island)."
