I have worked with INBRE, GS of America, CIFAL, UN, UH Manoa. Coupled with my work in INBRE, I have experience with IPA software, BioRender, cell culturing and the equipment used for such experience.

I have managed and coordinated interns, such as United Sates Coast Guard. This includes my liaison at the National Guard. Within this group of interns, I also managed international interns in the United Nations. I provided, cultural integration itinerary, local restaurant locations, provided complimentary meals, and coordinated housing and physical wellness gymnasium access.

In addition, I have worked closely with the Natural Science and Mathematics Dean and most, if not all, Professors located in Wesselkamper. I have worked closely under Hilary Corcoran, Kumu Kahoali'i Keahi-Wood, Helen Turner, and other staff related to cultural practices on campus and the Data Science programs.
