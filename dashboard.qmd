### Penguins have been peoples fascinations for millennial. I strive to provide visuals of their anatomy, population, and the inner workings of correlation to one another.

Such data can be utilized from the . This data was introduced to me through the CS 201 Introduction to R class.

This is the penguins data.

```{r}
library(tidyverse) 
library(here)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(janitor)
library(plotly)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}

penguins <- penguins %>%
  clean_names()

penguins <- read_csv("data/penguins_lter.csv")

ggplot(penguins, aes(x= sex, y = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_point()
```
